The code is designed to work with LunarLanderContinuous-v2 from OpenAI Gym.<br>
Please install OpenAI Gym environment on your computer first and then run this software.<br>
<br>
LQT control algorithm is implemented in 'heuristic' function in the lunar_lander_LQT.py. <br>
RL is a reinforcement learning code, and LQT-TRO is a LQT control with learning-based reference trajectory optimization.<br>
<br>
The details can be found in the following video: https://youtu.be/yb7yW_POwcQ<br>
<br>
Note1: RL and LQT-TRO codes are based on an open-source code developed by Clayton Thorrez (https://github.com/cthorrez/ml-fun/tree/master/ddpg). Special thanks to him.<br>

Note2: the code is still experimental, and might have some bugs. Any inquiry and feedback should go to ttanaka@uh.edu.
